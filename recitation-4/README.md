# Recitation 4: classes, objects, and sets

__Matthew Davis__ (based on Wode "Nimo" Ni's 2022 recitation 4)

_2024-02-09_

## Overview

In this recitation, we'll continue with our wordle example. This time, we will:

* Provide a list of valid letters to the player.
* Build an automated player that plays the game 100 times.

## Concepts

* Sets
  * Unique members
  * Unordered
  * Set operations: union, difference, etc.
* Objects and classes
  * Examples:
    * https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer
    * https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ 
  * Methods (aka "functions")
  * State (aka "fields")

```python
class Writer:
   row_count = 0  # field
   file = ""      # field
   # constructor
   def __init__(self, file):
     self.file = file
   # method
   def write_row(self, data):
     self.row_count += 1
     print("Wrote: ",data," to ",self.file)
writer1 = Writer("egg.csv")
writer1.write_row(["egg", "price", "color"])
writer2 = Writer("chicken.csv")
```

## Task 1: help the human players out

* Open the `recitation-24` repo in a new Codespace.
* `git status` to see that you have checked out branch `main`
* Create and checkout your own branch: `git checkout -b "<andrewid>"`
* Open `recitation-4/wordle.py` and find method/function `play()`
* `play()` is the interactive mode of the game and has an optional argument that tells it to print out valid characters after each step (`char_hint`).
* Play the game once to see this working: in your terminal:
  * `$ cd recitation-4`
  * `$ python3 wordle.py`
  * Notice the list of valid letters remaining is empty!
* In `recitation-4/wordle.py` add code to `valid_letters` to make it work.

In the desktop version of wordle, the game shows you the characters on a colored keyboard, which is helpful for keeping track of the valid characters to use. Let's try to do that. 

## Task 2: play the wordle game programmatically

The `WordleGame` __class__ inside `wordle.py` represents a single game of Wordle. Let's try using it first:

* Instantiate a `WordleGame` __object__ with a predefined answer `apple`.
  ```
  $ python3
  >>> import wordle
  >>> game = wordle.WordleGame('./words.json','apple')
  ```
* Guess 3 times, in which the final guess is `apple`.
  ```
  >>> game.guess('snarl')
  ['游린', '游린', '游릳', '游린', '游릳']
  >>> game.guess('apply')
  ['游릴', '游릴', '游릴', '游릴', '游린']
  >>> game.guess('apple')
  ['游릴', '游릴', '游릴', '游릴', '游릴']
  ```
* Print out the history of hints, and if you indeed won the game using methods defined in the class.
  ```
  >>> if(game.game_won):
  ...   print("YAY! You won!")
  ...   game.show_history()
  ...
  游린 游린 游릳 游린 游릳
  游릴 游릴 游릴 游릴 游린
  游릴 游릴 游릴 游릴 游릴
  ```

## Task 3: play the wordle game programmatically, many times

If you can play the game once with a program, you can play it many times. 

* In `play_wordle_games`, create a loop that goes through `n` times
* In each loop iteration:
  * Instantiate a `WordleGame` __object__ without a predefined answer
  * Take 5 guesses
  * Print out the history
  * Record if we won
* Finally, compute and print the success rate of your first aRTiFicIAl iNTelLigeNCe.
