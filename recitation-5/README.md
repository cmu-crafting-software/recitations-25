_2025-02-14_

## Overview

In this recitation, we'll continue working with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

## Instructions

1. Open this recitation's repo in a new Codespace: https://github.com/cmu-crafting-software/recitation05
2. Create and checkout your own branch: `git switch -c "[andrewid]"`
3. Read the readings and stations csv files using pandas and print them to the screen.
4. Print the columns of each dataframe to the screen using [`pandas.DataFrame.columns`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.columns.html)
5. Perform an inner join using [`pandas.DataFrame.join()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.join.html) between readings and stations.
6. Print the joined output to the screen.
7. **Stretch goal** Join all readings to stations to sensors and print the joined output to the screen. Try out the different types of joins (inner, left, right, and outter).
