## Recitation exercise

1. Read the readings and stations csv files using pandas and print them to the screen.
2. Print the columns of each dataframe to the screen using [`pandas.DataFrame.columns`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.columns.html)
3. Perform an inner join using [`pandas.DataFrame.join()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.join.html) between readings and stations.
4. Print the joined output to the screen
5. **Stretch goal** Join all readings to stations to sensors and print the joined output to the screen. Try out the different types of joins (inner, left, right, and outter).
